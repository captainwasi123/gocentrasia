               <h5> Meals and Special Requests </h5>
               <p> he menus are pre-set menus provided for meals on the tour. The types of meals are clearly indicated in the brochure. Unlike an airline, we cannot provide a special meal, nor do we guarantee a special diet to the client, except to the extent mentioned in the brochure and preferred by you. We however reserve the right to change the meal arrangement if circumstances make it necessary to do so. In the event that the client wakes up late and misses the breakfast off ered to him or the client is out on his own and reaches late or in case of delay of flights or for any other reason whatsoever the client misses any meal including breakfast offered to him by the company, then no claim can be made for the meal/ breakfast, which he has missed and not utilized.

            <div>
               <h5> Hotels </h5>
               <p> You will be out sightseeing most of the time and hence we have taken care to select hotels which are convenient and comfortable. Hence sometimes they may be located away from the city centre. Most of the rooms have private bath or shower. The category of hotels will vary according the tour package booked by you. The hotels will either be those shown in the itinerary or of the same category. Due to trade fairs and conventions in the cities the hotels may be blocked out for more than 2 yrs in advance. In view of this you may have to stay in hotels further away from the cities and itineraries may have to be altered / amended. Since the rooms are comparatively small, we would recommend only 3 persons in one room for your own comfort. Triple rooms are usually no larger than twin rooms and the third bed is often a rollaway cot put in a twin room for the night. Also due to favourable conditions in certain countries, most of the hotels may not have air conditioners / fans. All baggage and personal effects are at all times and under all circumstances your responsibility. We will not be responsible or liable in case of loss or theft or damage of such items from the hotel premises / Coach / Cruise / Airport / during travel or place of visit etc. Some hotels offer the facility of safe deposit lockers, which can be availed of by you at your own cost and risk. The company will not be liable for any loss / theft from the same. Any damages caused to the hotel rooms / Coach / place of visit etc. during your stay / tour / visit, shall be borne and payable by you, and the company will not be liable for the same. Company is not liable if there is sudden disruption / disorder of telephone, internet services, and other amenities while staying at the hotels. The company will also be not responsible for the facilities provided or not provided in the room / bathroom / hotel premises etc. by the Hotel or its staff. Rude or Unprofessional behavior of hotel staff does not come under the direct purview of the company and the company will not be responsible for the same. Facilities like mini bar, pay television channels, telephone etc are not complimentary and these facilities if used by the client have to be paid for by the client directly to the Hotel and such charges are not included in the tour cost. The client will have to abide by the check in /check out time of the hotel. Any changes made directly by the hotel come under their direct purview and we will not be liable for any compensation due to this change. </p>

               <h5> Brochure / Itinerary Accuracy / Change </h5>
               <p> All information given in this brochure / itinerary is based on the information available at the time of publication. We reserve the right to change any brochure /itinerary information before or after your booking the tour due to any events beyond our control. In case we are aware of any changes sufficiently in advance, we will notify you at the time of booking, otherwise our Tour Manager or Local representative will inform you of the changes. Major road works may necessitate route changes in the itineraries, Indian restaurants may close or change management, all of these may cause us to make changes in the itineraries. Where we know of these sufficiently in advance we will notify you, otherwise our Tour Managers or Local Representative will inform you of the changes on the spot. There are also very big fairs and exhibitions, where all the hotels are fully booked well in advance, and therefore it may be necessary to stay in hotels in other cities. We may often operate more than one coach per departure date. We may operate more than one group per departure or club 2 groups in one departure due to operational reasons. For the comfort and convenience of our clients, we will sometimes reverse the direction, or slightly amend the itinerary including the flight routing. We will advise you of these amendments, prior to the start of the tour or on tour. We may modify the itinerary based on various factors like maintenance of historical monuments, museums, major events like sports conventions, religious festivals, etc. We may take a detour to reach sightseeing places due to traffic conditions; road blocks and that may vary the course of itinerary. We reserve the right to change the departure date or cancel a departure due to lack of enough number of passengers and will not take any responsibility for any ticket of the client which they may have purchased in advance for sector within India or abroad. Clients are responsible for the adherence to time at all stages of the tour. In the event that a client misses on any part of the sightseeing tour or any such tour due to delay on his part, he will not be entitled to claim refund of the same. The company shall not accept any liability or responsibility for any damages, loss, baggage loss, injury, accident, death, breakdown, or irregularity, which may occur in carrying out the tour arrangement, weather conditions, strikes, war, quarantine and any other cause whatsoever and all such loss or expense must be borne by the client. We reserve the right to claim any additional expenses incurred due to delay or changes in schedules of train, aeroplane, bus, ship or other services. We further reserve the right to amend, alter, vary or withdraw any particular departure; excursions advertised or substitute a hotel of similar category if deemed necessary. You consent for the amendment/alteration in the brochure/itinerary. These terms shall be read together with the brochure/itinerary but these terms shall prevail over the brochure/itinerary and shall override the brochure/itinerary to the extent that it is contradictory or conflicting thereto  </p>
